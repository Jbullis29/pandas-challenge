## I created this code to sort through a set of data provided by a video game company and return the values most relevant to the company this includes:

  * Total number of Unique Players playing the game

  * The Number of Itemms availble for purchase, average price of Items and the total revenue generated from all the items purchased

  * The demographics of the Users playing the game by calculating the total unique players identifying as each gender and the percentage of players who identify as that gender

  * The count of purchases that each gender group made, their average cost of items they purchase, Total ammount of revenue each gender group brought to the company, and the   average   price that a single person in the gender 

* We then goup the data into age groups and add the groups to the main DF as column Age groups. Then calulate the count of eac unique players in each age group and what percentage of the total population they represent

* From there we run some calculations on the age groups such as total counts of purchases, average purchase price per age group, total revenue made from each age group, and average purchase ammount for the individuals in the age groups

* To help assist with some promotions or advertising we wanted to see who our top five purchasers their count of purchases and the average purchase price of the purchases tha person made. To determin our tops we calculated who had spent the most money on Items.

* Another helpful stat is to determin which Items are the most popular so that the company knows which ones to keep around and can maybe found out why they're popular in order to crate similar items

* Finally we sort the data by the most profitable items because popularity can also be inferred by the total revenue generated by the items.

## From the Data analysis we can conclude:
 * There are a total of 576 unique players playing the game and making purchases. The data is based on purchases ad not players so there could be more players they just havent made purchase
 * That there have been a total of 179 Unique items purchased with the average price of $3.05 so we can infer that the average player is will to spend $3.05 on an item
 * Based on our Gender demographics we can see that over 80% of the puurchasers are male and we can also infer that the majority of our players playing the game identify as male
 * Most of our purchases and a majority of our revenue comes from players who identify as male. We can also see the the average price among all the gender groups is about $3 and some change and so we can futher infer that the average price of items purchased doesnt change across the gender groups
